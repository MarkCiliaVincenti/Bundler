# Bundler
 A CSS, Less, Sass, Scss and JavaScript bundler for ASP.NET based on [Cruncher](https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/Cruncher) by [JimBobSquarePants](https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants).

Bundler makes optimizing your resources easy. It can bundle unlimited combinations of CSS, Less, Sass, Scss and JavaScript files.

Combining them, minifying them, and caching them in the browser, Bundler can handle nested CSS @import statements, re-maps relative resource urls and has a self cleaning cache should any changes be made to any of the referenced files. It can also parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to rules by Can I Use using AutoPrefixer.
